Welcome to the Public page for UQ Communication Systems. This page is mainly part of two courses at The University of Queensland: [COMS4105](http://www.uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=COMS4105) (undergraduate level) and [COMS7410](http://www.uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=COMS7410) (masters level).

The course was first run in 2013, and we used the RTL2832 USB sticks for software defined radio, python, C/C++ and MATLAB/Octave. On the public wiki we list some instructions for setting up the hardware, and some hints in developing under Matlab/Octave, or software defined radio in general.

Where relevant, some pages on the Internet are references or referred to.
